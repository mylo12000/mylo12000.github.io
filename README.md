# mylo12000.github.io

This is a project I am working on for school.
I am atempting to develope a website profoilio to showcase all of the code I have done.
I would also like to create a portfolio that is customizable for code or other mediums, for others to use.
 
 Process
 
 1. took my prior knolage of code and developed an outline of the website
    - consited of nav bar and styling the rest of the site
 2. took all my coding projects and put them in the outline / template I made
 3. reworked the styling to fit all the code and projects
 4. took other interests of mine and melded them into the webist
    - vieos
 5. kept working on the site, so that when I have new projects I can just drop them in.
